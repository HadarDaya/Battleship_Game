# Game instructions 
### Introduction to the game - arrangement of the submarine fleet
- In this game, a single player competes against the computer. Each player views the opponent's board without seeing any images of their fleet. 
  The player can see their own board with their fleet's layout and the opponentâ€™s hits.

- Before the game starts, the human player must arrange their fleet on their private board, which consists of 4 ships of varying sizes on a 10x10 grid.
- Ship Placement Rules:

  1. Ships can be placed either horizontally or vertically, but not diagonally.
  2. Ships must not overlap each other.
  3. Ships must not be placed adjacent to each other.
  4. Ships must be placed entirely within the boundaries of the grid, without extending beyond it.

### Game Flow
- After both players have confirmed their boards by clicking the "START" button, the game will begin, with the human player going first.
- The player will see a matrix with coordinates and must click on a square where they believe an opponent's ship is located. This click is an attempt to hit.
- Ensure that the click is within the opponent's grid and that the player has not yet hit this square.
- Each attempt, whether successful or not, will result in the square being blocked (i.e., it cannot be clicked again).
- If the player hits a ship, a fire icon will be displayed on the square. If the player misses, a miss symbol (X) will be shown.
- Additionally, if a player makes a correct guess, they will be granted an extra turn.
- A ship will be considered completely destroyed if all squares it occupies are marked.
- In every square surrounding a completely destroyed ship, a special symbol will appear to indicate that this square cannot be hit. This symbol also shows that the player did not hit a ship in the current square.

- Symbol "X" will appear when:
  1. The player attempted to hit a square but missed.
  2. The player has destroyed the entire ship, so the symbol "X" will appear around all adjacent squares.
   
- Symbol "Fire" will appear when the player successfully hits a square containing a ship.  

### Win Condition  
- The player who successfully sinks all of the opponent's ships first will be declared the winner.

### Loss Condition  
- The player who fails to discover and destroy all of the opponent's ships will be the loser.
